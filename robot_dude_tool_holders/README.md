 <b>Wall Mounted “Robot Dude” Tool Holders</b>
</div>

**Software:** Fusion 360   
**Time:** Through 2021

This was a set of robot inspired tool holders I completed throughout 2021 that were designed to be somewhat commercially viable 3D printed products. I was 19 when I designed these and I thought they were kind of cute, niche, and that some other members of the 3D printing community would enjoy them as well. I never fully pursued commercialization with these but I did make a Reddit post which got some attention and validated that there could be some interest in these products.



All of these were wall mounted, using philips screws to be fastened to drywall. If I were to pursue commercialization today I would make versions of these that could be fastened to a wall with sticky tape so they could be removed from the wall without needing plaster to repair it afterwards (make them attractive to people who live in rented apartments). Below are the five different designs that I made for common maker tools and stationary. 

Plier Holder












Caliper Holder

















Wire Snipper Holder

Allen Wrench Set Holder







Pencil Holder
