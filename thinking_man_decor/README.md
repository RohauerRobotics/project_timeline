This is another artistic project that I worked on intermittently throughout mid 2021. The concept is to display the silhouette of a person with their brain replaced with gears. I thought that this was an interesting kind of art piece which could have some market potential. I ended up making two different versions. The first one is a hand actuated device that relies on the user to make the gears spin by moving a spindle on the back side of the device. The second version’s gears are actuated by a small dc motor and sits above a flat backdrop for contrast.

The motorized version has some interesting design characteristics which are of note. For one the gears were my first implementation of a print-in-place multi-component design. They have an hour glass shape that sits at the central axis of the gear around which is a slightly spaced out hour glass which connects to the rest of each gear. This design choice is meaningful since it allows for a more efficient assembly process that would all together result in a lower product cost.

Overall I think these projects worked reasonably well. If I were to redo these projects today I would definitely redesign the gears, I didn’t use properly constructed spur gears for these projects so I had meshing and assembly issues. Also I would consider getting a multimaterial print head and integrating the gear axles into the backplate to reduce the number of parts and slimming the profile of the product.
