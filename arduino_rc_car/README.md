This is a short video that demonstrates an RC car I made using Arduino Uno in 2020. I used an nRF24L01+ module for communication, a L298N motor controller for actuating the small DC drive motors, a four AA rechargeable battery pack, and a LM2596 step down buck converter for powering the Arduino. While a simple design was used, this project exposed me further to embedded computing with Arduino, wireless communication, and motor control paving the way for further mechatronics projects that I would pursue in the future.
