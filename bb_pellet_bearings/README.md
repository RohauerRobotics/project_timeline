**3D Printed Housing for BB Pellet Bearings** 

**Software:** Fusion 360

**Time:** May - July 2019

After making my first solid CAD model I wanted to try and make a plastic ball bearing using some metal bb pellets that I had. The thought was that I could possibly integrate these bearings into future designs. At the time I was naive to the concepts of tolerance, dynamic behavior, and the effects of a material hardness and elasticity differential on long term housing deformation. Regardless of my ignorance I still attempted to construct these bearings and in the process I gained a healthy respect for the importance of understanding tolerance and the assembly process.

My plan was to design an outer shell and an inner core which would accommodate metallic bb pellets (designed for a bb pellet gun), print these parts out, and push the pellets into an indent allowing for a ring of pellets about the core to be formed and roll around the bearing core smoothly.

This project was meaningful to me since it was the first time that I had to iterate a design multiple times, in fact I think I changed the design and reprinted it about ten times. I wish I had taken a picture of all my attempts to solve this problem but I couldn’t find any on my phone or computer. The final design I came up with worked, it accommodated for the variance in 3D printed objects by adding extra space to the curves and it was sized just so, such that the bb pellets could all be pushed into place.

Since I was unable to find any of my original 3D printed bearings, I decided to do a redesign and fix the issues that were in the original version.

3D Printed Housing for BB Pellet Bearings - Redesign

Software: Onshape
Time: July 8th, 2025 (~30 mins to 1 hr)

My redesign uses a print-in-place assembly method, where the ball bearings are dropped into place when the printer is paused at the appropriate layer height. This fixes a major issue of the original design where I would have to shove the bb pellets into an indent on the side of the printed casing leading to a suboptimal surface for the balls to roll along. 



The next largest issue that my old design had was that it tried to pack the balls right next to one another with no spacing in between. This isn’t how professional bearings are designed since the ball bearings slide against one another in this configuration leading to wear and inefficiency. To solve this I simply filled in the space between the balls with a kind of curved macaroni type of shape, which spaces the balls away from one another without interfering in the rolling motion. 



It feels good to be able to quickly address some of the major issues that I had spent probably a dozen hours on about six years ago in about thirty minutes with the skills and knowledge that I have today. And while the print-in-place bearings are far from optimal they’re definitely better than the ones I made back then.
