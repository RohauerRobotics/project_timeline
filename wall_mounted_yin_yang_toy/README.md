This is a product-like design that I worked on in the later part of 2021. It is a fairly simple wall mounted Yin and Yang decoration. The object is composed of 5 parts. The wall mount, which has holes which allow fastening to a wall and a dovetail mount opening to connect to the middle joint. A “middle joint”, which joins the wall mount to ½ of the circular Yin and Yang design. A rotary locking mechanism, which prevents the axle of rotation from sliding back and forth. One half of the Yin and Yang circular plate, which has the axle of rotation and connects to the hole in the middle joint. And the other half of the Yin and Yang circular plate, which connects to the other half of the circle to complete the Yin and Yang design.

I think this design was fairly successful. It mounts nicely to a wall and holds steady so long as you are willing to drill into drywall. If I were to remake it today I would make a version that used sticky tabs for mounting the wall mount and I would get rid of the screw lock mechanism for holding the rotary lock mechanism into place since this could be achieved with some kind of plastic tab and wouldn’t require more hardware. I would also try to improve the interlocking mechanisms between the two halves of the Yin and Yang circle since the current version doesn’t hold each half in place as securely as ideal.
