Spring Winding Jig
Software: Fusion 360
Time: Around November 2019



I designed this around November 2019 with the intention to make a mini lathe. It didn’t work for the intended purpose due to power and structural integrity issues but I was able to adapt it and use it to make some low steel wire gauge compression and extension springs. 



This project was probably one of the first projects where I incorporated standard hardware components into a design. I used standard threaded rods that I bought from Home Depot or Lowe’s as well as machine screws and threaded inserts to hold most of the components together. I never really used this much but it was a stepping stone to making more complicated assemblies which I did later.
