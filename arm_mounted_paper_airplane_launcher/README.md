This was the first project I completed for a college engineering club. The goal was to build a paper airplane launcher for a club competition. I designed a reasonably complex arm mounted system for launching paper airplanes. It used a rechargeable battery bank wired to two small DC motors that were connected to two disks that had rubber-like padding for gripping the paper airplane during launch. The arm mount used two TPU 3D printed mounts which were connected to straps that were sewn onto buckles allowing for attachment and detachment easily. The two mounts mounted to two flat bars which allowed for the mounting of a set of guide rails in which the airplane could be loaded.

The design was fairly successful and functioned as desired.
