# TKinter Text Adventure Game 
**Dylan Rohauer** - November 2018

This was my first real Python project. I stopped working on it around Novemeber of 2018, after having spent the prior two months doing example problems from Zed Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/), which was a great introduction to object oriented programming, the command line, and Python. Prior to this project I had breifly worked on a couple programs in C++ and attempted to make a website for my brother's music using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However this corny, kind of embarrasing project was the first project that really made me feel like I could make things using code for the first time. **

Some of the features that I remember finding fascinating at the time were:

1. The ability to create and import custom files (I made a second file called sause.py that held libraries for each decision that was made)  
2. Making a class that self initialized  
3. Being able to index libraries for making decisions  
4. Creating a generalized TKinter loop that built and destroyed windows based on decisions set in the library  

I made this program in late 2018, which both feels like yesterday and a thousand years ago. This was before I chose to go to school for mechanical engineering and before the explosion of large language models and I’m grateful that I had the opportunity to experience, in a small way, what programming felt like before the machines could write everything for you. That being said this game was left unfinished and suboptimal, but that’s okay for a first game. (written July 2025)
