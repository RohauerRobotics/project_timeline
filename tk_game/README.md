# TKinter Text Adventure Game 
**Dylan Rohauer** - November 2018

**This was my first real Python project. I stopped working on it around Novemeber of 2018, after having spent the prior two months doing example problems from Zed Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/), which was a great introduction to object oriented programming, the command line, and Python. Prior to this project I had breifly worked on a couple programs in C++ and attempted to make a website for my brother's music using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However this corny, kind of embarrasing project was the first project that really made me feel like I could make things using code for the first time. **
