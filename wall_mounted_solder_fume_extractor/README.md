This is a collapsable wall mounted solder fume extractor that I designed in late 2021. This is another example of a product-like design that I have completed, it would require some design changes to be more marketable and easier to use but it demonstrates an advance in my personal product design. The fume extraction is accomplished by a variable speed box fan and a carbon activated air filter.

The body is composed of four 3D printed arms and a fan housing. Each of the arms is held in place by a 3D printed screw clamp, in which a machine screw is embedded (secured with super glue). These clamps tighten around the preceding arm or mount such that it deforms slightly and immobilizes the connecting arm via normal force and friction.

The last arm in the series connects to a swivel housing which has a dovetail-like joint which can slide into and out of a wall mount. This allows for easy installation and removal of the whole system.

Overall I’m fairly happy with how this project came out. It works reasonably well at removing carcinogens from solder fumes, and when it’s folded up it has a small enough footprint to not get in the way.

However, there are some things I would change if I were to redesign it today. 

Firstly, I would use a square (or hex) headed bolt/machine screw for the screw clamp. I used an M4 machine screw that had a socket head cap, which has a cylindrical face and required glue to be held in place. A square headed machine screw would also need to be glued in place, but the square (or hex) pocket in the clamp handle would provide greater leverage to the bolt/machine screw since the force transmitted to the threads wouldn’t need to be purely shear. It may also be beneficial to use a square nut rather than the threaded inserts as well.

Secondly, I would reduce the thickness of one of the sides of the base arm joint so it would deform more under less force. This should reduce the amount of force that needs to be applied to the screw clamp to hold the arms in place.

</p>

Another change I would make is at the fan housing. The current configuration allows for the fan and filter housing to swivel back and forth. In a future edition I would either have a mount that would allow tilt first then rotation, or just use a ball joint to allow the fan to face different positions with less hassle.

Additionally, I would reassess the arm configuration. The current arm series allows for the system to be collapsed, but I think another configuration might allow for the total space from the wall to be reduced further (more brainstorming required).

Below is a table of the total and unit price breakdown for the wall mounted solder fume extractor:
