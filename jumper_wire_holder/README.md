 <b>Jumper Wire Holder</b>

This is a simple jumper wire holder I designed to hold my electrical jumper wires. It consists of two racks that have fingers which can hold wires between them, and these racks are fastened to a rectangular base with machine screws threaded into heated threaded inserts. Nothing crazy but itâ€™s a useful storage device.
