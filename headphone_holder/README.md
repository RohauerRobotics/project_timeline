This was the first CAD design that I ever made! I designed it in Fusion 360 and I printed it with my first 3D printer, the JG Aurora A5S (2018 model). For some reason I split up my single solid headphone holder into five separate components. This made it into an assembly that I had to join together in order to export it as a single stl file, but Iâ€™ll get over it since this was literally the first thing I ever designed in CAD software. Below is the result I got after printing it out in the sample orange PLA they provided with my 3D printer.
